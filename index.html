            <h3>Math Teacher and Motivator</h3>
            <p>You might saw me teaching, sometimes playing and motivating someone to guide him or her for their carrier
                path. I have decent income from my teaching Mathematics mainly class XI,XII. But I have students of
                class
                IX,X. But I have huge interest in Computer IT field which was grown over my University life. I am not
                satisfying with teaching only on the recent areas but on the intersted field not only beacause of
                satisfaction but also you know the money does matters. But nobody pays me for motivating and playing.
                That's
                why I am learining and mastering web developer. I will not stop until I become the Web Development Hero.
